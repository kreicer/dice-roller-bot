             f"My name is <blue>Dice Roller<end>. I will be your guide in this awesome adventure. " \
             f"First of all, my core functionality - roll any dice you can image. " \
             f"And be you useful helper on this way, of course. " \
             f"I recommend start from something simple... Make a <green>d20<end> dice roll!\n\n" \
             f"You can roll simple dice, complex dice with multipliers and also with Postfixes! " \
             f"Let me show you some examples...\n\n" \
             f"Your command should start from <green>slash (/)<end>, local bot <green>prefix<end> " \
             f"or bot <green>mention<end>. " \
             f"Next part - command name. In our case it will be <green>\"roll\"<end> or just <green>\"r\"<end>. " \
             f"Yep, whitespace next. " \
             f"And from this moment only you decide what you want to roll. " \
             f"Dice may be simple like <green>2d20<end>  or complex like <green>3d8+d4-1<end>. " \
             f"Dice may contain <green>Postfix<end>. I will provide this as example - <green>4d8/dl:2<end>. " \
             f"Best part here - you can combine any dice and roll more than one dice per command. " \
             f"Like this - <green>/roll 3d6+d4 3d20/dh 2d20+2d4/dl:1-1<end>. " \
             f"You can get full available list with command <green>/postfix<end>."
